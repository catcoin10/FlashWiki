<h1>Elon Musk</h1>
  <b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> is a scientist and CEO that created a company called SpaceX that has full ownership of Planet Mars. He
  also owns a tech company called Tesla that makes cars that are designed to be very fast and allowed the unified government to
  ban fossil fuels outright (with the help of his Mega Solar company) and created the cure for aging that was released to the
  public on January 1, 2030. Plus, he even went to Mars, the planet that people have dreamed of reaching for centuries. And, he
  could barely dream of this when he was a kid.
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Elon Musk was seen as a "weird" kid in his school. This did not set him back because he did not care about the way that
  people looked at him. His mother told him not to care about that, either. This is because, even after Unification, people
  are still very self-centered. Also, it was not normal to research how to program computers. He was very interested in things
  such as the periodic table, protons and neutrons, the solar system, making computers faster, and a lot of things that people
  would not think about doing as a toddler for decades.
  <br>
  Elon was born in South Africa after the apartheid era. He was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and was randomly accepted
  into the best school in Europe. The school that he went into was called Global Sciences Worldwide school and was created in
  1961 during the Connecting '60s. The name gets the word "connecting" because the Internet was being built in the post
  Cold War environment. The reason that this is important is because the Cold War laid the framework for the modern Internet
  and Unification.
  <br>
  As a 7 year old, he became very interested in computers. This was because of an elective offered. Unlike planets where the
  Flash is only a fictional character, electives are offered to everyone and this offering started in the 1960s in this school
  and spread throughout the world. He learned that computers had a key problem: they were not compatible with each other.
  This was a problem that the computer scientists had somewhat solved by creating the Transmission Control Protocol, a protocol
  that is used to send data acros the Internet that is stimll used today.
  <br>
  In order to fix this problem, he created the HTML Web design language. This was a baby step and was done when he was only 11
  years old. The browser was not exactly a browser. He shared the browser and sold the first 250 copies for two dollars each.
  He did not set a fixed price because he felt that this technology was too expensive to put a price on it forever. He spent
  the 500 dollars of income on computer research books. He started keeping a journal on things like the weather and whatever
  he thinks about. He does not let <i>anyone</i> see everything he writes in the journal and he encrypts it using increasingly
  sophisticated algorithms.
  <br>
  When young Musk learned about the Cold War at the age of eight, he felt that it was really sad that we had to go through a
  whole war against communists. He wrote this sentence in a school essay, "Unlike what many Mericans or Americans felt, communism
  is not the enemy we think of it as. Communism is a byproduct of the wrongs of capitalism and takes things too far."
  <br>
  Elon Musk was worried about the internet having spying issues. One of the entries of his journal that he published is "I
  want people to be able to use the Internet without people see what I am doing." He did not go into detail, but he claims to
  have written that he thought about using prime numbers to hide data at the age of 14. Later on, he began to write about
  how C, the existing computer programming language, is relatively complicated and that he wanted to create another one called
  Python, named after the pre-Unification show Monty Python and he made continued improvements to make it faster and able to be
  in a kernel.
  <br>
  Unlike in this world, school is now able to continue going after someone graduates from 12th grade. Kindergarten is now known
  as grade 0 and you could go as many grades as the school thinks that you are learning. He went to school until grade 17 and
  then started the companies Tesla, SpaceX, and Terra Solar. The reason that he kept going is because he learned about how to
  learn how to program computers.
  <br>
  As humans have for thousands of years, Musk has always feared death. But, unlike most people who wanted to, he was going to
  try to end death. But, it took him and his low-independence robots 56 years to do this before his first journal entry that
  seriously discussed the topic to finally do this.
  <br>
  Elon wrote in a journal entry "I think that it is absurd that the currency that is around the world, the Unity Dollar,
  decreases in value 2.5% per year." We do no have access to all of his private journal entries, but he does share some of them
  with us because we are in a different universe that is incapable of affecting that other universe.
  <h3>Science life</h3>
  When Elon finished 17th grade, he used the money that he had made from a 13th grade project called bitcoin to start his own
  tech company. The company that he created was initially called "Elon's Computers" and was a success. He wrote his open source
  software that outperformed his competitors. Though he initially sold the software for $10 per computer (worth $35 in USD in
  this world in 2016 because the money is worth 3.5x as much because there is 2x as much money and 7x as much productivity,
  evening out to 3.5x as the average exchange rate for a dollar on this earth.), he started selling the software for free
  on the 500th computer, meaning that he had $5,000 or $17,500 in this earth's dollars. The hardware made him $35 per piece.
  The computers were slightly faster than average. In 1980, the average processor speed was 50 MHz and his computer had a
  processor speed of 62.5 MHz and was 10% cheaper than the average of $500 per computer.
  <br>
  Elon invested $40,000 into his project Bitcoin in the year 1983, when each coin was worth $143 which was the lowest point
  as people started to lose confidence in bitcoin worrying that it was not a real currency. Musk hired a trainer with his other
  money and then, after his 5 year investment in his trainer was over, his project became (theoretically) worth billions of
  dollars. There were even new products called altcoins.
  <br>
  Even though unlike this earth, people knew who bitcoin's creator is, they forgot about him after 1979, when it was first
  created. The bitcoins in 1988 were worth $2,650 each and he decided to sell 40 percent back into Unity Dollars, 20 percent
  into the altcoin Smallcoin (an equivalent of Litecoin) and Etherspirit, and keep 20 percent in bitcoin.
  <br>
  With the almost 3/4 million dollars that he had made, he was going to try to colonize Mars. First, the person that he talked
  to thought hat he was crazy, but once they had learned that he helped stop global warming and created HTML, they wanted to
  take him seriously. Elon Musk was building his Martian fleet. He designed scientific equipment and they thought it looked
  good and took him seriously.
  <br>
  Unable to go to Mars right away, he started his own company called Tesla Motors. Their cars are on every continent, including
  Antartica. The company he made turned his remaining $240,000 that he had when he started the company into $50 million in its
  3rd year in 1993. They outperformed the fossil fuel (gasoline) cars that were on the road and are now able to be bought for
  $75,000 in our Earth's dollars ($21,500 in their money)
  <h3>Ethics</h3>
  Elon Musk is interested in the ethics of certain things. There are many things that he is undecided on, but he has determined
  that the way that they used to do things was wrong. He thinks that it is wrong to cage people for the rest of their lives,
  and that they should be rehabilitated instead. This is because the human body has a fundamental, physical limit that varies
  slightly based on how much mental and/or physical strengh the person has, to resist being changed. Interpol (not unlike the
  Interpol in this Universe) is considering doing this strategy. Elon does not believe in killing people. Despite the fact that
  the human population has hit 12 billion in 2028, he said that the population should keep growing.
  <br>
  He says that people should cooperate with each other. The reason that he likes (and secretly works with) The Flash is because
  he can travel faster than the speed of light. This is seen by him as useful because he can send his space ship into Mars
  in as little time as he wants to.
  <br>
  However, he does not believe that progress should be rushed. For example, his faster than light project took 6 years of
  research before he got to Mars. Once the research was complete, he ended up sending his robot crew there in 12 minutes, more
  than twice as fast as they could go at light speed. This was first achieved by the usage of tachyon particles and then, as
  Musk's companies grew, he was able to make things travel faster.
  <br>
  Because he did not want to hurt anyone, he used 
  <br>
  In the 2000s, he was the man who was putting the fossil fuel CEOs on trial for polluting the environment. They were sent
  to a place called the London prison, named after the city where they hold the trials. (London is one of the few large cities
  that kept its name after Unification.) They were denied bail and were forced to do the trial from the jail cells.
  <br>
  Unlike the Iron Heights prison, the London prison is designed for people who try to do stuff that is very infamous and was
  worse than what they do at Iron Heights. Iron Heights is located in Hourglass Intersection, which is in what was known as
  Central America.
  <br>
  Musk supports the Citizenship Score Program Act of 2032, which scores people based on who they are. However, he says that it
  may be invasive on privacy and that the program should look at only things that are important to citizenship.

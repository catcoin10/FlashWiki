<h1>Elon Musk</h1>
  <b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> is a scientist and CEO that created a company called SpaceX that has full ownership of Planet Mars. He
  also owns a tech company called Tesla that makes cars that are designed to be very fast and allowed the unified government to
  ban fossil fuels outright (with the help of his Mega Solar company) and created the cure for aging that was released to the
  public on January 1, 2030.
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Elon was born in South Africa after the apartheid era. He was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and was randomly accepted
  into the best school in Europe. The school that he went into was called Global Sciences Worldwide school and was created in
  1961 during the Connecting '60s. The name gets the word "connecting" because the Internet was being built in the post
  Cold War environment.

  As a 7 year old, he became very interested in computers. This was because of an elective offered. Unlike schools where the
  Flash is only a fictional character, electives are offered to everyone and this offering started in the 1960s in this school
  and spread throughout the world. He learned that computers had a key problem: they were not compatible with each other.

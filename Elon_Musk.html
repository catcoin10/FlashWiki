<h1>Elon Musk</h1>
  <b>Elon Reeve Musk</b> is a scientist and CEO that created a company called SpaceX that has full ownership of Planet Mars. He
  also owns a tech company called Tesla that makes cars that are designed to be very fast and allowed the unified government to
  ban fossil fuels outright (with the help of his Mega Solar company) and created the cure for aging that was released to the
  public on January 1, 2030.
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Elon Musk was seen as a "weird" kid in his school. This did not set him back because he did not care about the way that
  people looked at him. His mother told him not to care about that, either. This is because, even after Unification, people
  are still very self-centered. Also, it was not normal to research how to program computers. He was very interested in things
  such as the periodic table, protons and neutrons, the solar system, making computers faster, and a lot of things that people
  would not think about doing as a toddler for decades.
  <br>
  Elon was born in South Africa after the apartheid era. He was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome and was randomly accepted
  into the best school in Europe. The school that he went into was called Global Sciences Worldwide school and was created in
  1961 during the Connecting '60s. The name gets the word "connecting" because the Internet was being built in the post
  Cold War environment.
  <br>
  As a 7 year old, he became very interested in computers. This was because of an elective offered. Unlike schools where the
  Flash is only a fictional character, electives are offered to everyone and this offering started in the 1960s in this school
  and spread throughout the world. He learned that computers had a key problem: they were not compatible with each other.
  <br>
  In order to fix this problem, he created the HTML Web design language. This was a baby step and was done when he was only 11
  years old. The browser was not exactly a browser. He shared the browser and sold the first 250 copies for two dollars each.
  He did not set a fixed price because he felt that this technology was too expensive to put a price on it forever. He spent
  the 500 dollars of income on computer research books. He started keeping a journal on things like the weather and whatever
  he thinks about. He does not let <i>anyone</i> see what he writes in the journal and he encrypts it using incrasingly
  sophisticated technology.
  <br>
  Elon Musk was worried about the internet having spying issues. One of the entries of his journal that he published is "I
  want people to be able to use the Internet without people see what I am doing." He did not go into detail, but he claims to
  have written that he thought about using prime numbers to hide data at the age of 14. Later on, he began to write about
  how C, the existing computer programming language, is relatively complicated and that he wanted to create another one called
  Python, named after the pre-Unification show Monty Python and he made continued improvements to make it faster and able to be
  in a kernel.
  <br>
  Unlike in this world, school is now able to continue going after someone graduates from 12th grade. Kindergarten is now known
  as grade 0 and you could go as many grades as the school thinks that you are learning. He went to school until grade 17 and
  then started the companies Tesla, SpaceX, and Terra Solar. The reason that he kept going is because he learned about how to
  learn how to program computers.
  <br>
  Elon wrote in a journal entry "I think that it is absurd that the currency that is around the world, the Unity Dollar,
  decreases in value 2.5% per year." We do no have access to all of his private journal entries, but he does share some of them
  with us because we are in a different universe that is incapable of affecting that other universe.

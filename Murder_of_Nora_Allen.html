<h1>Murder of Nora Allen</h1>
  The <b>murder of Nora Allen</b> was a tragic event that killed <a href="Barry_Allen.html">Barry Allen</a>.
  At the time of the incident, young Barry was not believed. The police thought his dad commited the murder and
  he was seen as crazy.
  <h3>Before</h3>
  There is not much known about Barry before this, but his father was a doctor and his mother's job is not known. There was no
  sign of Henry Allen acting bizarre and he was blamed nevertheless.
  <h3>During</h3>
  Barry Allen saw a flash of light and he was very surprised to see this happen. He later described this event as "something
  impossible". This was very disturbing to Barry Allen, especially considering the fact that his dad was a doctor. The flash
  of light turned out to be a fake version of <a href="Harrison_Wells.html">Dr. Wells</a> who came from the future. An older
  version of him tries to stop the murder but fails.
  <br>
  There is little known about why Mr. Allen was killed. A possible motivation is the Reverse Flash, who came from the future, going
  after the Flash trying to stop him from becoming the Flash before he gains the actual power of becoming the Flash.
  <h3>After</h3>
  Barry Allen was taken with <a href="Joe_West.html">Joe West</a>, who had a daughter named <a href="Iris_West.html">Iris</a>.
  Although Joe arrested him, he said to Barry that he thinks he was right and that he was killed by someone else. He continued
  to go to school as he usually did. But, later in his life, this made him want to be a Crime Scene Investigator in the nearby
  Central City. He grew up with Iris, with whom he later got engaged with and eventually married.
  <br>
  Barry Allen's grades took a hit temporarily. Although he was just in 4th grade, his dad cared a lot about his grades being low.

<h1>Murder of Nora Allen</h1>
  The <b>murder of Nora Allen</b> was a tragic event that killed <a href="Barry_Allen.html">Barry Allen</a>.
  At the time of the incident, young Barry was not believed. The police thought his dad commited the murder and
  he was seen as crazy.
  <h3>Before</h3>
  There is not much known about Barry before this, but his father was a doctor and his mother's job was a scientist There was
  no sign of Henry Allen acting bizarre and he was blamed nevertheless. Two months ago, Barry Allen was given a science book as a
  birthday present and because his mother, the one who was killed, got promoted at her science job.
  <h3>During</h3>
  Barry Allen saw a flash of light and he was very surprised to see this happen. He later described this event as "something
  impossible". This was very disturbing to Barry Allen, especially considering the fact that his dad was a doctor. The flash
  of light turned out to be a fake version of <a href="Harrison_Wells.html">Dr. Wells</a> who came from the future. An older
  version of him tries to stop the murder but fails.
  <br>
  There is little known about why Mr. Allen was killed. A possible motivation is the Reverse Flash, who came from the future
  going after the Flash trying to stop him from becoming the Flash before he gains the actual power of becoming the Flash.
  Another possible motivation is that Henry Allen was too caring for the Reverse Flash to allow to exist. What is known is that 
  the fingerprints found on Mrs. Allen's body were from an unknown person who was determined to be the Reverse Flash.
  <br>
  The event happened while young Barry was reading the science book that he was given. He was watching his fish tank because he
  was thinking about how the page was talking about how water was the most common liquid in the universe. This, he knew, was
  because it said that hydrogen and oxygen were the most common reactive elements in the universe in the last chapter.
  <h3>After</h3>
  Barry Allen was taken with <a href="Joe_West.html">Joe West</a>, who had a daughter named <a href="Iris_West.html">Iris</a>.
  Although Joe arrested him, he said to Barry that he thinks he was right and that he was killed by someone else. He continued
  to go to school as he usually did. But, later in his life, this made him want to be a Crime Scene Investigator in the nearby
  Central City. He grew up with Iris, with whom he later got engaged with and eventually married.
  <br>
  Barry Allen's grades took a hit temporarily. Although he was just in 4th grade, his adopted father cared about his grades being
  low. Joe West, his adopted father told him that he wasn't positive, but he thinks that his dad was innocent because of the way he
  behaved when he was being questioned. As a teenager in 11th grade, he began studying chemistry after his science teacher taught
  him. He switched to foresnic science. He still talked to his father from prison right up to his release.

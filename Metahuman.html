<h1>Metahuman</h1>
A <b>metahuman</b> is a human that is affected by dark matter that was created in the <a href="STAR_Labs.html">STAR Labs</a>
particle accelerator explosion. These people can either be good or bad. Barry Allen was a good metahuman who is known publicly
as the Flash. Sadly, some metahumans are bad because their either desiring vengeance or are greedy. Here is an incomplete list of
metahumans:
<ul>
<li>The Flash</li>
<li>Captain Cold</li>
<li>Savitar</li>
<li>The Blackout</li>
<li>Ronnie Raymond (FIRESTORM)</li>
</ul>
  The metahumans were not seen as a problem when the accelerator went off. But, the problem was not the accelerator, but the people
  it hit. They, not the particle accelerator, are to blame for the bad things that had happened. Metahumans are defined by the
  <a href="CCPD.html">Central City Police Department</a> as "a human that has been physically enhanced in a way not possible
  without an event with quanum mechanics, such as the particle accelerator explosion that the government contractor STAR labs
  experienced".
  <h3>History</h3>
  Metahumans were first created by STAR Labs. <a href="Harrison_Wells.html">Harrison Wells</a>, the CEO of STAR Labs, ignored
  warnings and is considered by this bystanding website as partially responsible for the metahumans. Before the Flash came out, the
  bad metahumans could do whatever they wanted. But, that all changed when Barry Allen was empowered.
  <br>
  Metahumans are very smart. There was a man named Clifford DeVoe. He created bus metas, people who were on a bus. DeVoe is able to
  calculate <i>everything</i>, except for love. The Central City Police Department defines metahumans as "a living member of the
  species <i>Homo sapiens</i> with abilities that are not given by natural evolution". This definition has been adopted by other
  police departments
  <br>
  The handling of malicious metahumans has been an intensely debated topic because even though the death penalty idea is gone for
  regular humans, but, because of their differences and difficulty to stop and control when they do bad stuff, they were considered
  risky. Though the government had determined being a metahuman was a neutral power, it can be used for good or bad stuff. To make
  matters more complicated, some people were given metahuman powers because they were seen as useful to someone named DeVoe, a mad
  scientist the police and Interpol have been unable to catch because he is not located in ths universe.

  The concept of metahumans has caused political tensions in the West Indian region of Eurasia. This is because the Flash never
  comes there even though sometimes some metahumans flee there so they think they cannot be found. This changes when Nora Allen,
  daughter of Barry Allen and Iris West-Allen comes from the future where humans are immortal.
  <br>
  Even though Interpol could have caught the Arrow as Oliver Queen, Interpol is unable to catch msot metahumans without the help
  of the Flash.
  <h3>Business Views</h3>
  Businesses, unlike in other universes, typically favor what the population favors.
  <h3>Government Views on Metahumans</h3>
  The worldwide government established around 1960 is supportive of metahumans because they are able to use their powers for good
  even though they don't always do that.

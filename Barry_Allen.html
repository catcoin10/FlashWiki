  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Barry was born outside of Central City. He was a good boy, but he never dreamed of being the Flash. He was a kind person as a
  child. He had a friend named Iris. After the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his mother.</a>, his dad fell into
  a depression after subsequently being arrested.
  <h3>Life As A CSI</h3>
  Both before and after becoming the Flash, Barry was commited to protecting the city and not letting people be falsely blamed for
  things like his dad did. Barry Allen was struck by lightning in a particle accelerator created by STAR Labs, an extragovernmental
  science organization that recieves government funding. He does not tell anyone he is the Flash except for his close relatives and
  close friends. He works with his adopted dad Joe West on criminal cases including metahumans.
  <h3>Life as The Flash</h3>
  Barry Allen saves many people and likes to be famous, but with pseudononymity. He works with STAR Labs, which knows he is The
  Flash, and is sworn to secrecy about it. He has battled many villains, including but not limited to <a href="Leonard_Snart.html">
  Captain Cold</a>, <a href="Savitar.html">Savitar</a>, and many others. After fighting Savitar, he came across a bad person who
  had an extreme brain power that was so intense that his body could not sustain him so he kept on moving into different people's
  bodies. He called the bodies "hosts" and he calculated every fact intensely except for love. While this is happening, he is, like
  his dad, falsely blamed for the murder of his wife on the day after his wedding.

<h1 id="top">Barry Allen</h1>
  <b>Bartholomew Henry Allen</b>, known in the public as <b>The Flash</b>, is a superhero that has saved lives by running really
  fast. Barry Allen was born to two parents, Nora Allen and <a href="Henry_Allen.html">Henry Allen</a>. The way that he got his
  superpowers is because <a href="STAR_Labs.html">STAR Labs</a> particle accelerator explosion. This company is similar to a
  company on <a href="Earth_57.html">Earth 57</a>, our Earth. His Earth of Residency is Earth 1, which <a href="Oliver_Queen.html">
  The Arrow</a> has the same Earth of Residency.
  <br>
  Barry Allen is a crime scene investigator for the <a href="NCPD.html">National City Police Department</a>. He is a colleague of
  <a href="Joe_West.html">Joe West</a>, the man that raised him after his father was falsely blamed for his murder. The Flash
  (Barry Allen) tried to stop the event by creating an alternate reality called Flashpoint. This reality turned out vary badly
  for him and was created as a failed attempt to escape Flashpoint.
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Barry was born outside of Central City. He was a good boy, but he never dreamed of being the Flash. He was a kind person as a
  child. He had a friend named Iris. After the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his mother.</a>, his dad fell into
  a depression after subsequently being arrested. He was, however, able to get out of the depression mostly by himself after 3
  months.
  <br>
  When he was 4, Barry Allen was diagnosed with a genetic anomaly. The anomaly that he was diagnosed with was similar to that
  found in people with autism, but he did not meet the clinical definition of autistic because he was able to interact with
  people at a normal ability. No one, not even Joe West, knows about his difference. This was done in the summer before school
  started so he could have time to study. What wanted to study was how the planet rotated around the solar system. Another thing
  that he studied was the periodic table.
  <br>
  When he was in 2nd grade, he made a balloon out of hydrogen. His mom and dad were very happy to hear that their boy was a
  scientist. This was a very interesting thing to many people. He explained to the class that the reason that they use helium in
  in the balloon is because helium is a noble gas and the lightest and most inert one on the periodic table. He also talked about
  how the noble gases were noble because their electron shells were full.
  <br>
  In the Desert Hexagon, also known as Africa here, there is a lot of poverty, even in that universe. There is not just one reason
  that Africa has so much poverty. The people in Africa, known before 1968 as blacks, were discriminated against because a man
  named Christopher Columbus, a Spanish conquest king (known here as a conquistador; almost everyone speaks English because it
  is the universal language.) that killed a lot of people because he wanted gold because the Spanish government demanded it.
  He did a research project for school and home in 6th grade to show why the Desert Hexagon is so poor. He also talked about the
  amount of water.
  <br>
  Even though when he was born after the world had been unified, he was still not satisfied because he was there was still crime.
  But,crime did not become a big problem until metahumans began doing things because metahumans were not a thing back then. After he
  graduated high school, he went to the community college for six years and then went to become a Central City Police Department
  engineer.
  <h3>Life As A CSI</h3>
  Both before and after becoming the Flash, Barry was commited to protecting the city and not letting people be falsely blamed for
  things like his dad did. Barry Allen was struck by lightning in a particle accelerator created by STAR Labs, an extragovernmental
  science organization that recieves government funding. He does not tell anyone he is the Flash except for his close relatives and
  close friends. He works with his adopted dad Joe West on criminal cases including metahumans.
  <h3>Life as The Flash</h3>
  Barry Allen saves many people and likes to be famous, but with pseudononymity. He works with STAR Labs, which knows he is The
  Flash, and is sworn to secrecy about it. He has battled many villains, including but not limited to <a href="Leonard_Snart.html">
  Captain Cold</a>, <a href="Savitar.html">Savitar</a>, and many others. After fighting Savitar, he came across a bad person who
  had an extreme brain power that was so intense that his body could not sustain him so he kept on moving into different people's
  bodies. He called the bodies "hosts" and he calculated every fact intensely except for love. While this is happening, he is, like
  his dad, falsely blamed for the murder of his wife on the day after his wedding.
  <br>
  He was good friends with for his life, and married, Iris West, a newspaper writer. As The Flash, he told her that she should
  stop writing about him. But, she kept going even though he told her. She called the Flash "the Streak" and did her blogging in
  public and worked for Starling News, Inc.
  <h3>Life after being accused of murder</h3>
  Barry Allen was falsely accused of murdering <a href="Clifford_DeVoe.html">Clifford DeVoe</a>'s wife, a "mad brainiac".
  As we know, like his father, he was innocent. It was not easy because even though later on his dad was able to tell the Earth
  3 that he was the Flash, he could not tell anyone because it would be a safety risk and it would be hard for him to be a
  celebrity. Before his arrest, Barry Allen, as CSI, had been following Mr. DeVoe. He filed a restraining order but then asked him
  to come meet him to talk about what he did shortly before he was accused. He accepted, and told him that he knew he was the
  Flash.
  <br>
  Although everyone says that Dr. Wells is the chief STAR Labs scientist, he is only an assistant because Barry Allen is the
  smartest person in the world because he is the fastest and learns far quicker than any non-Flash human. But, the Reverse Flash
  was slightly smarter until his determination stopped him form having that title. He uses this intelligence to write newspapers
  that genuinely seem like they are written by normal people and do other things. This makes him a secret friend of Elon Musk that
  no one knows about.
  <br>
  Barry Allen, later on, started trying to make a copy of himself. This happened in 2022, when the news said that he vanished. He
  made two copies of himself, and the original version vanished. But, like bitcoin, he was in multiple places at once and can't
  vanish. His first copy was acting like a normal person (and the Flash) and his second  copy was typing, eating, running, and
  sleeping in a secret room. This replica (when there were two Barry Allens) took up 25 percent of him and the other one had 75
  percent. In this secret version of Barry Allen that only the people at STAR Labs, Barry Allen himselves, and Elon Musk know
  about, he is doing all of the things that normal humans could only dream of doing.
  <br>
  <h3>Trips to the Desert Hexagon</h3>
  In 2026, Barry Allen sent a copy of one of his time remnants on a trip to the Desert Hexagon. Initially, he tried to do the trip
  by himself. Fortunately for him, because he was the Flash, he was able to drink the salt water because his digestive system could
  filter out the salt because it was a part of his superpower he didn't know he had. He, however, did tell his girlfriend Iris
  about a copy of himself. Even if that copy died or was killed, he would still be alive. The reason that he makes these trips is
  because in the Desert Hexagon, known in better-educated circles as Africa, there is a lot of poverty and kids starving. He could
  not make more time remnants because if he did, he would have serious problems with his abilities. To conceal his identity, he
  used the name "Henry Jackson", and no one knew who he was because he did not publicly come out as the Flash and they did not have
  the resources to check his identity.
  <br>
  There is still a lot going on in the Desert Hexagon. Sometimes, there are rogue tribes. There is a place that has not been
  touched by Unification because of a technicality called "Bir Tawil", which is now known as the "Forbidden Triangle". There have
  been a lot of people who tried to go there, and that place is the smallest concern in the Desert Hexagon for the Flash. His
  biggest concern is water usage. Even though in August 2026 85% of the population had access to drinking water, only 65% do in
  the Desert Hexagon. This is mostly because of it being a desert. Barry Allen sometimes patrols (the villagers who are slowly
  emerging from their old ways don't know who the heck it is) the streets. Sometimes, rogue people start hitting things. When
  someone tries to steal someone's food, they aren't arrested. Instead, Barry Allen in the Flash's suit goes to feed him or her
  food. This brings people trust and pride in the Flash's mission.
  <br>
  In October 2026, five months after his mission, he cut off his time remnant because it was slightly difficult on his mind
  because being in three places at once was a <i>little</i> too much for him, even as a Flash.
  <h3>Politics</h3>
  As the Flash, Barry Allen has became the enemy of a few politicians that, fortunately, never win anymore. They call themselves
  strict readers, which are also known as conservatives. The term strict reader refers to the conservative value that everything
  needs to be followed very strictly. One candidate, James L. Dodson, said that he should be given the death penalty. This caused
  public alarm because the death penalty was abolished 40 years before the Flash took power by the Stop Governmental Killing Act.
  Mr. Allen opposes strict readers because in his view, strict readers are making life harder for everyone, including themselves.
  <br>
  The usage of the word politics is misleading because the concept of politics does not exist anymore because what is seen in this
  world as far future stuff is happening then and now. First, there is a central government with multiple leaders that runs around
  the world.
  <br>
  Despite this being mentioned, this is mostly in the past, and there are neither liberals nor conservatives in this world because
  in 1965, the concept of politics was erased because politics was not necesary because disagreement was seen as a bad thing. The
  things that I wrote about Barry Allen and strict thinkers are written because of stuff that happened in the past and on Earth
  8317, our Earth.
  <br>
  Politics is still around somewhat, but even though everyone thinks the same generally, they disagree on how the government does
  things. In the Decentral Ledger, a newspaper that claims to have 30 people writing for it, he writes about issues from a pro
  Flash persepective. It gets a lot of views and is very popular. There are many pseudonyms used. The website has come under
  scrutiny because one time a pseudonym being used was one that a real person and the articles were kept because the website has a
  blockchain file maintenance system.
  <br>
  Despite the fact that Barry Allen does not kill people as the Flash, he is considering supporting a law that allows for prisoners
  to kill themselves if they will not be released from prison. He is not sure about this decision, because he feels that everyone
  has a right to live.

<h1 id="top">Barry Allen</h1>
  <b>Bartholomew Henry Allen</b>, known in the public as <b>The Flash</b>, is a superhero that has saved lives by running really
  fast. Barry Allen was born to two parents, Nora Allen and <a href="Henry_Allen.html">Henry Allen</a>. The way that he got his
  superpowers is because <a href="STAR_Labs.html">STAR Labs</a> particle accelerator explosion. This company is similar to a
  company on <a href="Earth_57.html">Earth 57</a>, our Earth. His Earth of Residency is Earth 1, which <a href="Oliver_Queen.html">
  The Arrow</a> has the same Earth of Residency.
  <br>
  Barry Allen is a crime scene investigator for the <a href="NCPD.html">National City Police Department</a>. He is a colleague of
  <a href="Joe_West.html">Joe West</a>, the man that raised him after his father was falsely blamed for his murder. The Flash
  (Barry Allen) tried to stop the event by creating an alternate reality called Flashpoint.
  <h3>Early Life</h3>
  Barry was born outside of Central City. He was a good boy, but he never dreamed of being the Flash. He was a kind person as a
  child. He had a friend named Iris. After the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his mother.</a>, his dad fell into
  a depression after subsequently being arrested.
  <h3>Life As A CSI</h3>
  Both before and after becoming the Flash, Barry was commited to protecting the city and not letting people be falsely blamed for
  things like his dad did. Barry Allen was struck by lightning in a particle accelerator created by STAR Labs, an extragovernmental
  science organization that recieves government funding. He does not tell anyone he is the Flash except for his close relatives and
  close friends. He works with his adopted dad Joe West on criminal cases including metahumans.
  <h3>Life as The Flash</h3>
  Barry Allen saves many people and likes to be famous, but with pseudononymity. He works with STAR Labs, which knows he is The
  Flash, and is sworn to secrecy about it. He has battled many villains, including but not limited to <a href="Leonard_Snart.html">
  Captain Cold</a>, <a href="Savitar.html">Savitar</a>, and many others. After fighting Savitar, he came across a bad person who
  had an extreme brain power that was so intense that his body could not sustain him so he kept on moving into different people's
  bodies. He called the bodies "hosts" and he calculated every fact intensely except for love. While this is happening, he is, like
  his dad, falsely blamed for the murder of his wife on the day after his wedding.
  <br>
  He was good friends with for his life, and married, Iris West, a newspaper writer. As The Flash, he told her that she should
  stop writing about him. But, she kept going even though he told her. She called the Flash "the Streak" and did her blogging in
  public and worked for Starling News, Inc.
  <h3>Life after being accused of murder</h3>
  Barry Allen was falsely accused of murdering <a href="Clifford_DeVoe.html">Clifford DeVoe</a>'s wife, a "mad brainiac".
  As we know, like his father, he was innocent. It was not easy because even though later on his dad was able to tell the Earth
  3 that he was the Flash, he could not tell anyone because it would be a safety risk and it would be hard for him to be a
  celebrity. Before his arrest, Barry Allen, as CSI, had been following Mr. DeVoe. He filed a restraining order but then asked him
  to come meet him to talk about what he did shortly before he was accused. He accepted, and told him that he knew he was the
  Flash.
  <br>
  <h3>Politics</h3>
  As the Flash, Barry Allen has became the enemy of a few politicians that, fortunately, never win anymore. They call themselves
  strict readers, which are also known as conservatives. The term strict reader refers to the conservative value that everything
  needs to be followed very strictly. One candidate, James L. Dodson, said that he should be given the death penalty. This caused
  public alarm because the death penalty was abolished 40 years before the Flash took power by the Stop Governmental Killing Act.
  Mr. Allen opposes strict readers because in his view, strict readers are making life harder for everyone, including themselves.
  <br>
  The usage of the word politics is misleading because the concept of politics does not exist anymore because what is seen in this
  world as far future stuff is happening then and now. First, there is a central government with multiple leaders that runs around
  the world.
  <br>
  Despite this being mentioned, this is in the past, and there are neither liberals nor conservatives in this world.

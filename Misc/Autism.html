<h1>My Autism</h1>
  I am an autistic person (the only reasons that I refer to myself as autistic is because I feel that it matters because it
  helped me with my computer abilities and that I have a silly social skills class and IEP that picks on me.) who is interested
  in numbers, liberal politics, cryptocurrency, superheroes like and including The Flash (what the upper dir is about), and
  how the human brain works.
  <br>
  The title of the document is somewhat misnamed, it is more about myself than myself being different cognitively.
  <h3>My IEP</h3>
  I am not going to go into personally identifiable details here (ie my name and parents info), but I need to say that I have
  a love-hate relationship with it. But, I do need to write about a few important things about it. First, I have to do this
  class that I am enslaved to and was enslaved to for 5 consecutive years and will be enslaved to for at least 1 more year.
  But, my special education provides services that I feel that I need like having extra time on tests, having a mentour, and a
  gurantee that I will get study guides for tests. I am glad I have it but I sometimes feel like I am a slave to the fact that
  I am a minor because even though my family cares they won't allow me to get rid of my social skills class that 96%-98% of the
  school does not have.
  <h3>My interest for computers</h3>
  As of writing, I took 2 computer classes in high school. I like creating relatively simple (relatively complicated if you are
  not a computer programmer or want to be one) programs in the Python language that are in the other repositories.
  <h3>Later in life</h3>
  My family is making a suggestion to me that is troubling me: that I stay in high school until I am 21. The reason that this
  is so troubling is because it could lower my cognitive abilities by depriving me from school. Although the opposite happens
  in relatively short time periods, say 3 days, being away from schoolwork for 3 years in a vocational program may potentially
  be mind numbing in a similar way that playing a video game would be. This is because the school makes the post grads as they
  are called deliver coffee in the morning like a video game and working silly jobs like the YMCA and Burger King. Think about
  it: the vocational programs are Orwellian. They teach you that you need to work and be lazy in your cognitive expansion and
  that you need to have a job and not go to college when everyone else does. Other people may be a part of it, but I want no
  part of it.

If you are in this folder, please feel free to browse. There is (pseudononymized) stuff about my school and home life. Don't
worry about me, I scrub my real name and change it to "catcoin10" if necessary. I have my school work and a lot of other
things here, which is why I call this folder misc, short for miscellaneous.

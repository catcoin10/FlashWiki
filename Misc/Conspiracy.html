<h1>The American Conspiracy</h1>
The American conspiracy is a conspiracy by the governments of countries around the world to help America. Think I'm crazy? Look around the news in the last 10 years. See how many people are getting arrested for doing things the government does not like? Look at Anonymous and Occupy. Both of these are gone because the elite killed them. How? With handcuffs. Prison is a weapon and the First Amendment is the only way to fight it.

The opposition knows to target people in a seemingly indiscriminate way. I am forced into a social skills class with 5th grade reading material (as of April 2019, I am in 10th grade.) Laws that are created tend to anger highly leftist individuals like me. There is no point to the Second Amendment because

The Empire, just like the Roman Empire depends on a conservative legal system to stay in power. As I type this document, more and more stuff comes into my head. This is the real reason that we are based off of Rome in our system of government: the high ranking of the Supreme Court and classification of information nearly gurantees their power.

Assange was arrested because he is an enemy of the American empire
96% of the population opposes this cause in whole or in part because it has not been talked about. But, I am confident we can grow to at least 20% of the population. I am probably overwst
The reason that we have global warming continuing is because the "emperors" (Donald Trump)
The government targets the younger opposers the hardest because the young have the highest number of years that they can be caged for and may see the days that the US empire is overthrown.
The First Amendment angers the government because it stops them from arresting leftists.
The government does not indoctrinate people yet because the resistance has been clamped down by the media.
Blockchain is the solution that may take control out. The reason that they make Republicans like Ron Paul support it is to distract me and others who think like me politically from the power of blockchain.
I believe in a supernatural deity that we do not see.

Note: I thank the founding fathers and Voltaire because they are the only reason that I am not in prison. There are many "laws" such as classification of information and anti-hacking laws that are designed to circumvent this law. They are traps and I am smart enough not to fall into them. Ideas can grow at an up to exponential rate and once they reach a critical size/mass, they can spiral out of control.

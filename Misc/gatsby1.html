<h1>Gatsby Chapter 5</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Nick is jealous of the difference between Gatsby and him because he got the less well off side of it. This is because they
    both share a lawn. People naturally are jealous of what they don't have.</li>
    <li>I think that Gatsby wanted bootlegging because it was described as "confidential" and something that can make him a decent
    amount of money. At the time the book was written, bootlegging was illegal because of a law called Prohibition that banned the
    sale of alcohol.</li>
    <li>Because of Nick (the narrator of the Great Gatsby) expecting Gatsby to come to the room, in a very rich looking suit
    balanced with a gold tie, he is nervous. I suspect that when it is referring to "two o-clock" that talks about "a greenhouse"
    coming to the house. The greenhouse seems to be like the greenhouse effect because the person looks tired and sick.</li>
    <li>The weather is showing a nervous but tempered mood. The description of the droplets shows that the weather is very calming
    to Gatsby despite whatever is happening.

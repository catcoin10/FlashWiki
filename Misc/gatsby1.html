<h1>Gatsby Chapter 5 Questions</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Nick is jealous of the difference between Gatsby and him because he got the less well off side of it. This is because they
    both share a lawn. People naturally are jealous of what they don't have.</li>
    <li>I think that Gatsby wanted bootlegging because it was described as "confidential" and something that can make him a decent
    amount of money. At the time the book was written, bootlegging was illegal because of a law called Prohibition that banned the
      <i>sale</i> of alcohol.</li>
    <li>Because of Nick (the narrator of the Great Gatsby) expecting Gatsby to come to the room, in a very rich looking suit
    balanced with a gold tie, he is nervous. I suspect that when it is referring to "two o-clock" that talks about "a greenhouse"
    coming to the house. The greenhouse seems to be like the greenhouse effect because the person looks tired and sick.</li>
    <li>The weather is showing a nervous but tempered mood. The description of the droplets shows that the weather is very calming
      to Gatsby despite whatever is happening in his life.</li>
    <li>When the author talks about how the scenery looks, it is partially symbolic because he was showing that the things in the
    story had the power to influence the emotions of the characters in the book. Particularly, the description of the flowers shows
    the calm and <!--loving --> kind mood towards Daisy that Nick has.</li>
    <li>I think that because the previous thing that I had to highlight talks about the tea being awkward and I think that the tea
      will be bizarre partially because earlier in the story someone had punched a woman for repeatedly saying Daisy in protest.
      <!-- I side with that woman because I think that there is a line between privacy and censorship. --> Also, it seems on the
      surface as if there is a love triangle going on. (there isn't.)</li>
    <li>Nick is playing the role of being the person that is defending Daisy. I think that he is kind of telling the truth but he
      wants her even though she and Tom already have each other. It is hard to tell whether or not the truth is being told because
    of the obscurity in their attitude. But, we know that they seemed happy to see each other.</li>
    <li>The two (Nick and Daisy) are getting more comfortable with each other. It seemed almost romantic because it was described
      as "radiating a new [self]" and Daisy being "smeared with tears". The usage of the word radiated is ironic and may have to
      do with radium because of the usage of the word glowing and the element being used at that time. <!--SÃºbeme el radio chicas-->
    </li>
    <li>Gatsby does not seem to make the money through ethical means. He thinks that because the things that he describes are legal,
      it's OK to do them. For example, he says to Nick "I was in the oil business and ... the drug business." Then, he mentioned
      what the proposal was: bootlegging alcohol, which was illegal at the time the book was about.</li>
    <li>They wanted to experience nature, but they also wanted to see the green light emanating from Daisy's beach because Daisy
      was in that car.</li>
    <li>Gatsby almost fell down an entire flight of stairs. This made the two parts of his house different because he wanted to keep
      his mind on Daisy when he sleeps in his bedroom. This is partially because that is where people sleep and before and sometimes
      while people sleep, they think about things.</li>
    <li>The importance of the scene involves how Gatsby's anger about Daisy made him start throwing his shirts. Then, Daisy, finally
      starting to think about the shirts, decides to pick up the shirts. She was upset and thought out loud that she "never [saw]
      such beautiful shirts before," which means that she not only liked the shirts, but also (probably) still liked Gatsby. This is
      potentially a major turning point in the story.</li>
    <li>The color green may signify the jealousy of Gatsby because he is jealous of his girlfriend Daisy. It is not just the color,
      it is also the fact that the lighthouse was green. Plus, sometimes, he goes outside to look at the lighthouse because he thinks
      about who his ex-girlfriend Daisy is and was.</li>
    <li>I am slightly surprised, but not really because he seems to have too many friends to have a "best" one. Dan Cody was addicted
      to alcohol and died of an overdose.</li>
    <li>Yes, because when people have dreams about poeple and the person they are dreaming about is close enough, the dreams have the
      potential to become true. Because of this, I don't think he is delusional. To use the text, it says that he had a "creative
      passion", probably because he sincerely loved her.</li>

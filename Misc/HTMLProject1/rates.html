<h1>Rates of Increase</h1>
  This page shows the rates that various environmental factors and the actual global warming change. There are images that are from other Web sites that are on the Internet.
  <h3>Keeling Curve</h3>
  The Keeling Curve is a picture of the atmospheric CO2 levels. Unlike you might think, although the rise of CO2 happens on a fairly predictable basis, it varies slightly based on the season and actually goes down during the summer. Normally, it would look like a zigzag, going up from October to April and then dropping back down from May to September. This is because plants are absorbing the CO2 from the air. Although there is still CO2 being absorbed, it is not enough to slow it down, so it looks like a "one step down and two steps up" graph.

  As you can tell by looking at the image closely, CO2 levels rise by an average of 1.78 parts per million per year. Although you may not be able to tell easily, it is accelerating as you go up. According to <a href="https://www.co2.earth/co2-acceleration">a prominent environmental website</a>, CO2 output accelerated, with the increase happening the most rapidly in the previous decade (2005-2014) with an average of 2.14 ppm per year.

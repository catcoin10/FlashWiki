<h1>Rates of Increase</h1>
  This page shows the rates that various environmental factors and the actual global warming change. There are images that are from other Web sites that are on the Internet.
  <h3>Keeling Curve</h3>
  The Keeling Curve is a picture of the atmospheric CO2 levels. Unlike you might think, although the rise of CO2 happens on a fairly predictable basis, it varies slightly based on the season and actually goes down during the summer. Normally, it would look like a zigzag, going up from October to April and then dropping back down from May to September. This is because plants are absorbing the CO2 from the air. Although there is still CO2 being absorbed, it is not enough to slow it down, so it looks like a "one step down and two steps up" graph.

  As you can tell by looking at the image closely, CO2 levels rise by an average of 1.78 parts per million per year. Although you may not be able to tell easily, it is accelerating as you go up. According to <a href="https://www.co2.earth/co2-acceleration">a prominent environmental website</a>, CO2 output accelerated, with the increase happening the most rapidly in the previous decade (2005-2014) with an average of 2.14 ppm per year. Though a year may seem like a fairly long time especially if you're young, even though a year is relatively small on both human life and global warming scales, this is happening 10 times faster than at any time that we have ever seen in the history of the planet. Years add up, and they have added up to more than 100 parts per million over just 60 years.

  Although the majority of this will be in the what you can do section, it is important to talk about the CO2 level in the future. The level of 500 parts per million will <i>probably</i> be reached in my lifetime. But, when (or if) that number is reached depends on a variety of things. It depends on the public's willingness to change the tide.

  According to <a href="http://igutek.scripts.mit.edu/terrascope/ppmbau.png">this image</a>, which we seem to be emulating as of now, we will reach that level around 2037. If our world upgrades our people to larger places and out of poverty within the next decade without doing enough about the global warming, it will come in the next decade. But, if we do try hard to fix it, we could push it back to 2060 or even further, allowing us more time to study other planets like Mars. The reason that this level is important is because it is the limit on which we can live without setting off feedback loops or triggers that bring it (and other gases with it) higher.

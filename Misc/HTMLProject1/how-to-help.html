<h1>How To Help</h1>
  Though the social fabrics causing the problem of climate change are complex, there are a few things that need to be talked about. First, the emissions of greenhouse gases is a large problem. Here are the biggest personal causes:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Using excess electricity</li>
    <li>Eating meat</li>
    <li>Driving long distances</li>
    <li>Overeating</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  It is not too late to help stop the global warming, so these items above show what we can do as a society to tackle this issue. For example, even without government intervention, corporations are creating energy efficient devices because, they too care about it because it also threatens their survival further into the future. People are learning about the seriousness of the issue, and as I said earlier, people are working to solve the issue.
  <h3>Using excess electricity</h3>
  People's devices use excess energy. The excess electricity used comes from the Internet usage as well. <a href="https://climatecare.org/infographic-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet/">According to this image,</a> a large e-mail attachment can use 50 grams of CO2. So, this means, on average, 1 gigabyte of data may use up to 4.4 pounds or 2 kilograms of data. This may be lower due to increased environmental care. Here are some suggestions on lowering electricity consumption:
  <!-- Assuming a large attachment is 25MB, 50 * (1/0.025) = 2000 -->
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Unplug outlets for things that don't need to be plugged in. This uses "vampire power" and can generally be easily stopped.</li>
    <li>Lower the quality for YouTube videos from 720p to 480p. This will make the energy required to send the data less.</li>
    <li>Take shorter showers. This reduces the water heater's electricity or gas consumption.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat temperature and raise the AC temperature to reduce load on the AC and heat devices.</li>
    <li>Reduce your phone usage by as much as you feel comfortable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Eating meat</h3>

  The farming of cattle is very intensive on methane emissions and is even more intense on water usage. The image above shows the amount of CO2 required to produce each type of milk. Despite the fact that almonds use a lot of water, the effect is cancelled out by the relatively few almonds (this number is estimated to be ~2-5 for popular brands) used by popular brands.

<h1>How To Help</h1>
  Though the social fabrics causing the problem of climate change are complex, there are a few things that need to be talked about. First, the emissions of greenhouse gases is a large problem. Here are the biggest personal causes:
  <br>
  <ol>
    <li>Using excess electricity</li>
    <li>Eating meat</li>
    <li>Driving long distances</li>
    <li>Overeating</li>
  </ol>
  <br>
  It is not too late to help stop the global warming, so these items above show what we can do as a society to tackle this issue. For example, even without government intervention, corporations are creating energy efficient devices because, they too care about it because it also threatens their survival further into the future. People are learning about the seriousness of the issue, and as I said earlier, people are working to solve the issue.
  <h3>Using excess electricity</h3>
  People's devices use excess energy. The excess electricity used comes from the Internet usage as well. <a href="https://climatecare.org/infographic-the-carbon-footprint-of-the-internet/">According to this image,</a> a large e-mail attachment can use 50 grams of CO2. So, this means, on average, 1 gigabyte of data may use up to 4.4 pounds or 2 kilograms of data. This may be lower due to increased environmental care. Here are some suggestions on lowering electricity consumption:
  <!-- Assuming a large attachment is 25MB, 50 * (1/0.025) = 2000 -->
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Unplug outlets for things that don't need to be plugged in. This uses "vampire power" and can generally be easily stopped.</li>
    <li>Lower the quality for YouTube videos from 720p to 480p. This will make the energy required to send the data less.</li>
    <li>Take shorter showers. This reduces the water heater's electricity or gas consumption.</li>
    <li>Lower the heat temperature and raise the AC temperature to reduce load on the AC and heat devices.</li>
    <li>Reduce your phone usage by as much as you feel comfortable.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Eating meat</h3>

  The farming of cattle is very intensive on methane emissions and is even more intense on water usage. The image above shows the amount of CO2 required to produce each type of milk. Despite the fact that almonds use a lot of water, the effect is cancelled out by the relatively few almonds (this number is estimated to be ~2-5 for popular brands) used by popular brands.

  <br>
  Back to the actual meat, meat is very water intensive. The water is not mainly from the cows and other animals, but from the <i>land</i> that is used to grow the crops. Plus, the land to grow the food is usually on deforested land or in very rural areas where there is not a lot of people which makes the farming easier because farming is usually done on large spaces. <a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Cows-are-hogs-infographic.jpg">According to this image</a>, cows use 86% of agricultural biomass (some of which is potentially food) but only give 8% of food that humans eat.
  <br>
  In order to help, you don't even have to stop eating meat! You can just start eating chicken. For example, I try not to eat beef as much because of the cholestrol and the CO2 levels shown above. According to <a href="https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/150925153610-food-climate-chart-two-degrees-exlarge-169.jpg">an image source from CNN,</a> (no endorsement of CNN intended) eating chicken uses roughly 90% less CO2 than the same amount of beef. This is because chickens are birds and birds process grains more efficiently.

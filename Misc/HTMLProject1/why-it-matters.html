  As our species grows in knowledge, we have an insatiable hunger for more knowledge. <!-- Insatiable means hunger that can't be satisfied --> But, we also have a seemingly insatiable hunger for carbon. This hunger for carbon, fortunately, can be reduced. We all live on this planet. Even though there are protest signs that say "There Is No Planet B", Planet B (Mars) should be a goal to accomplish, but we should not need to go to Planet B because of our sloppiness in caring for the environment.

(This is assuming 600ppm) When people who believe in fossil fuels say that fossil fuels are increasing plant productivity, it <i>technically</i> does, but the pollen becomes worse for people with allergies.

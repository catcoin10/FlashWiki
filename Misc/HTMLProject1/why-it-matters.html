  As our species grows in knowledge, we have an insatiable hunger for more knowledge. <!-- Insatiable means hunger that can't be satisfied --> But, we also have a seemingly insatiable hunger for carbon. This hunger for carbon, fortunately, can be reduced. We all live on this planet. Even though there are protest signs that say "There Is No Planet B", Planet B (Mars) should be a goal to accomplish, but we should not need to go to Planet B because of our sloppiness in caring for the environment.

  <h1>Why it matters</h1>
<p style="color: #00c000;">
  Every day that we are alive in this world, so far, we have lived on the planet Earth. This is because the Earth, with <i>maybe</i> the future exception of Mars, is the only planet suitable for human life. Every year that there is no major action means that our planet gets a fraction of a degree hotter. These fractions add up and by the end of the century, if we don't do anything, we will be all the way up to 6 degrees Celsius.

<h1>STAR Labs</h1>
  <b>STAR Labs</b> is a government contractor that studies the collision of subatomic particles for military purposes. This
  institution has done public events in the past, like turning on the particle accelerator. It is ran by
  <a href="Harrison_Wells.html">Harrison Wells</a>, a scientist that allowed the explosion to happen because it was not really
  Harrison Wells, but the <a href="Reverse_Flash.html">Reverse Flash</a>.
  <h3>Before the particle accelerator explosion</h3>
  STAR Labs was founded in 1904 by Thomas Edison as a division of the Accelerati as a secret organization. In 1917, Edison began
  relocation efforts to transfer control to another scientist. Some of the substances were kept under Accelerati control. In 1919,
  Albert Einstein was selected. He kept the secret of where it came from. Calculating the best way to conceal the equipment
  required the best analog computers and smallest safe computations possible. Ernest Rutherford was invited as the assistant
  director of what was then known as the Star Division of the Accelerati. The motto was "studying the makeup of the stars and the
  Earth". Rutherford was selected because Rutherford discovered that atoms had protons, which the Accelerati put to special use
  to create and study radioisotopes beginning in 1932.

  After the Accelerati's division from STAR Labs happened, STAR Labs announced it existed in 1929. Because they no longer had
  access to the material that they had when the Accelerati was in charge, they had financing problems because science institutions
  had a hard time believing that they were what they thought they were. In 1948, after Hitler was defeated, the First Technological
  Surge began. 5 million people around the world were voluntarily hired to research mathematics and the spacetime continnum. These
  people were able to stay up for long periods of time and some of the people were not exactly normal but very smart. STAR Labs
  benefitted from this and after the International Unification in 1956, which put all of the countries

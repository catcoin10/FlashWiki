<h1>STAR Labs</h1>
  <b>STAR Labs</b> is a government contractor that studies the collision of subatomic particles for military purposes. This
  institution has done public events in the past, like turning on the particle accelerator. It is ran by
  <a href="Harrison_Wells.html">Harrison Wells</a>, a scientist that allowed the explosion to happen because it was not really
  Harrison Wells, but the <a href="Reverse_Flash.html">Reverse Flash</a>.
  <h3>Before the particle accelerator explosion</h3>
  STAR Labs was founded in 1904 by Thomas Edison as a division of the Accelerati as a secret organization. In 1917, Edison began
  relocation efforts to transfer control to another scientist. Some of the substances were kept under Accelerati control. In 1919,
  Albert Einstein was selected. He kept the secret of where it came from. Calculating the best way to conceal the equipment
  required the best analog computers and smallest safe computations possible. Ernest Rutherford was invited as the assistant
  director of what was then known as the Star Division of the Accelerati. The motto was "studying the makeup of the stars and the
  Earth". Rutherford was selected because Rutherford discovered that atoms had protons, which the Accelerati put to special use
  to create radioisotopes in 1932.

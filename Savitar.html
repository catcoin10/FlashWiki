 because his father was killed. He was reported to have beenoriginally a Cold War fighter who had a supersonic jet who took the

 <h3>Before becoming a supervillain</h3>
 Before he became supervillain, as a young man, he was drafted into the Vietnam War. He did not want to go and wished that he could
 time travel himself into the future. After Canada extradited him back to the United States, ten years before the world united,
 he was arrested. This led him down a long road of vengeance that turned him into a villain.

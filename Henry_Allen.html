<h1>Henry Allen</h1>
<b>Henry Allen</b> is the father of <a href="Barry_Allen.html">The Flash</a>, the subject of this website. He was falsely blamed
for the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his wife</a>, which caused strain on the Flash.
<h3>Before the murder incident</h3>
  Before the murder by the <a href="Reverse_Flash.html">Reverse Flash</a>, he helped Cisco Ramone's brother Dante after he fell and
  fractured his wrist. He damaged his ankle but it didn't fracture. He went to school in NYC, a city that is far away and is
  now known as The City of the New Idea. This name comes from the fact that New York is where a lot of inventors, artists, and
  musicians grew up.
  <br>
  Before and during his career as a doctor in Solarkey, the village that Barry Allen grew up in, (named that because the town
  a very good view of the stars relative to other towns in the area), he worked with the Global Sciences Commitee on studying
  the effects on global warming and how to reverse them. The reason that he was so compelled in this field was because of his
  family's roots in the scientific community. Although he never met Elon Musk himself, he was able to meet with one of his key
  assistants and bring up a lot of solutions.
  <br>
  For example, he helped design a carbon dioxide sucking device that strips the carbon atom out of the carbon dioxide. This
  device was studied by other people and was implemented by the Committee after 2 years of study. The CO2 levels peaked at 335
  parts per million in 1974 and they were able to go back down to 245 ppm with the help of the technology that he invented.
  <br>
  Because of his (and his wife Nora)'s interest in science, he was able to help stop global warming and research the causes of
  the common cold. Unfortunately, because he was falsely accused of murder, he was not able to know about the new flu vaccine
  except through the one way prison radio. 
  <h3>During and after the incident</h3>
  While the incident was happening, he was screaming to him to run away because something bad was happening. That bad thing was his
  wife being killed by the Reverse Flash. His son was left powerless. He spent almost two decades in prison until he was released
  after Barry Allen (The Flash), Joe West, and CCPD dropped the case and proved it was the Reverse Flash. The Reverse Flash was
  also a speedster. He was the opposite. Sadly, this took years to prove.
  <br>
  After he was released and reunited with his family, he went to Earth 3 to become a Flash because a second particle accelerator
  exploded. This explosion was caused by an <a href="Accelerati.html">Accelerati</a> explosion that they were ordered to say it
  was caused by STAR Labs.
  <br>
  Though the motivation and logic behind the framing is unclear, it is believed that it may have had to do with his helping of
  other people. When he got out of prison, he said that he recognized the Reverse Flash when he was pretending to be Harrison
  Wells because he forgot (or decided not to because it was part of his plan).
  <h3>People he saved as the Flash on Earth 3</h3>
  Unlike on Earth 1, the Flash is not pseudononymous. Though he does not talk about his son being the Flash, he saves multiple
  people when he is able to. He is a doctor and people are very happy to recieve treatment from the Flash. The reason that Barry
  Allen is not able to state his identity is because murders of people are relatively common and on Earth 3 murders occur very,
  very, rarely.
  <br>
  Unlike Barry Allen, we can write about all the heroic actions taken by Henry Allen. We can't write all of Barry's because there
  are too many to easily write. These events are written in chronological order.
  <ol>
    <li>Saving ten people in a fire burning on the Edison building.</li>
    <li>Developing a vaccine for a strain of ebola that would have taken the other scientists weeks to develop in just an
      hour.</li>
    <li>Stopping a rogue division of the Accelerati from releasing tritium into the Glades of Starling City.</li>
  </ol>

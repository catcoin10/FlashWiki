<h1>Henry Allen</h1>
<b>Henry Allen</b> is the father of <a href="Barry_Allen.html">The Flash</a>, the subject of this website. He was falsely blamed
for the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his wife</a>, which caused strain on the Flash.
<h3>Before the murder incident</h3>
  Before the murder by the <a href="Reverse_Flash.html">Reverse Flash</a>, he helped Cisco Ramone's brother Dante after he fell and
  fractured his wrist. He damaged his ankle but it didn't fracture. There is not much known about his patient list because it is
  confidential and we only have info from sources that are willing to talk to us.
<h3>During and after the incident</a>
  While the incident was happening, he was screaming to him to run away because something bad was happening. That bad thing was his
  wife being killed by the Reverse Flash. His son was left powerless. He spent almost two decades in prison until he was released
  after Barry Allen (The Flash), Joe West, and CCPD dropped the case and proved it was the Reverse Flash.

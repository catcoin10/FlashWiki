<h1>Henry Allen</h1>
<b>Henry Allen</b> is the father of <a href="Barry_Allen.html">The Flash</a>, the subject of this website. He was falsely blamed
for the <a href="Murder_of_Nora_Allen.html">killing of his wife</a>, which caused strain on the Flash.
<h3>Before the murder incident</h3>
  Before the murder by the <a href="Reverse_Flash.html">Reverse Flash</a>, he helped Cisco Ramone's brother Dante after he fell and
  fractured his wrist. He damaged his ankle but it didn't fracture. He went to school in NYC
  <h3>During and after the incident</h3>
  While the incident was happening, he was screaming to him to run away because something bad was happening. That bad thing was his
  wife being killed by the Reverse Flash. His son was left powerless. He spent almost two decades in prison until he was released
  after Barry Allen (The Flash), Joe West, and CCPD dropped the case and proved it was the Reverse Flash. The Reverse Flash was
  also a speedster. He was the opposite. Sadly, this took years to prove.
  <br>
  After he was released and reunited with his family, he went to Earth 3 to become a Flash because a second particle accelerator
  exploded. This explosion was caused by an <a href="Accelerati.html">Accelerati</a> explosion that they were ordered to say it
  was caused by STAR Labs.
  <h3>People he saved as the Flash on Earth 3</h3>
  Unlike on Earth 1, the Flash is not pseudononymous. Though he does not talk about his son being the Flash, he saves multiple
  people when he is able to. He is a doctor and people are very happy to recieve treatment from the Flash. The reason that Barry
  Allen is not able to state his identity is because murders of people are relatively common and on Earth 3 murders occur very,
  very, rarely.

  Unlike Barry Allen, we can write about all the heroic actions taken by Henry Allen. We can't write all of Barry's because there
  are too many to easily write. These events are written in chronological order.
  <ol>
    <li>Saving ten people in a fire burning on the Edison building</li>
    <li>Developing a vaccine for a strain of ebola that would have taken the other scientists weeks to develop in just an hour</li>

<h1>Accelerati</h1>
  The <b>Accelerati</b> is a top secret institution that msot governments granted immunity to because they wanted the Accelerati
  to be able to do what it needs to without government inteference. It was founded in 1903 as a result of the success of the light
  bulb. The Accelerati had Edison living using a special cesium ion battery created in 1935 that held him until 1991.
  <h3>First 17 years</h3>
  The Accelerati was able to obtain immunity from William H. Taft in 1911, the fifth to last president until Roosevelt abolished
  the office in 1944 before he died of polio. Other countries such as the UK followed suit, which granted immunity in 1914. A
  particularly chaotic time at the Accelerati was the relocation of Star Labs. As the Accelerati gained more and more scientific
  knowlege about the stars and atoms, began experimenting with radioisotopes such as hydrogen 3 and carbon 14.

  Despite the fact that they commited crimes, none of them went to jail until 1973 when the government determined that their
  immunity was not necessary and that "too big to jail" is not a thing anymore. They did not jail the members that were
  lower in the ranks; they only went after the ones that were high-up decision makers.

  The Accelerati is still around and is overseen by many scientists including Jesse Wells, <a href="Elon_Musk.html">Elon Musk</a>,
  <a href="Barry_Allen.html">The Flash</a>, and some others including <a href="Felicity_Smoak.html">Felicity Smoak</a>, who
  worked with the Arrow. The Flash 
  <h3>After 17th year and before Unification</h3>
  One of the Accelerati scientists designed a way to create radioisotopes on a large scale. The first such experiment involved
  tritium ice. This expirement involved making pure tritium water, cooling it to twenty degrees Fahrenheit (18 degrees cooler than
  it needed to be) and letting it sit for a long time. The scientist that did this, Rick Lincoln, forgot that he did the experiment
  in the first place and the ice decayed into helium and oxygen gases and did not harm anyone
  <h3>Now</h3>
  Now, the Accelerati is a government institution. Some of the older criminals (aging will be cured by Elon in 2029) were caught
  by the Flash because they were harming people with chemicals and radioactive isotopes such as hydrogen 3 and polonium 210 that
  emit a type of radiation that cannot be detected because it is stopped very easily by body tissue and air. The Accelerati's
  creator Edison died in 1991 of the cesium battery failure. The agency no longer has the immunity that it once had and does not
  feel that it needs it anymore.

    <h1>&thorn;e Story About Zeus</h1>
    <h2>Before Earth</h2>
    <h3>Cowland</h3>
    &thorn;e earth's location was filled with cows on a flat plane. &thorn;is was a very boring land with bright greenish-blue light everywhere. It had no people or any animals except for grass and cows.
    <h3>Day of &thorn;e Big &thorn;ree</h3>
    <p>
    Contrary to mainstream Greek mythology, &thorn;ere were only 4 gods in the beginning: Zeus, Poseidon, Gaea, and Hades. Four of &thorn;e other gods were born later out of cow phoenixes.
    <br>
    Gaea, &thorn;e wise one, decided to kill six cows. &thorn;is was to create a place for them to live peacefully and possibly have &thorn;e ability to eat.

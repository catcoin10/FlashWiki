<h1>Oliver Queen</h1>
  <b>Oliver Daniel Queen</b>, also known as <b>Arrow</b>, <b>The Arrow</b>, is a vigilante that lives in Starling City who
  hides as who you would least expect it to be: a 1 percenter. He was active from the years 2015 to 2022. This happened because
  he was trapped on an isolated island with bad people that tortured people. Before he got captured, he was the same type of
  person that he targets while he is hunting down bad people as the Arrow.
  <h3>Life on the island</h3>
  "The island", a remote island in the sea close to Upindian Eastern Eurasia, was a place that he first learned to use the bow
  and arrow. Like the Flash, he did not want to kill people, but he was under the threat of having his friends tortured, beaten
  and/or killed, so he had no choice. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.
  <br>
  What inspired him to become the Arrow was his father telling him that he has "failed this city". This is the same thing that
  the Arrow told people before he arrowed them.

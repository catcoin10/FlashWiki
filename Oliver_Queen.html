<h1>Oliver Queen</h1>
  <b>Oliver Daniel Queen</b>, also known as <b>Arrow</b>, <b>The Arrow</b>, is a vigilante that lives in Starling City who
  hides as who you would least expect it to be: a 1 percenter. He was active from the years 2015 to 2022. This happened because
  he was trapped on an isolated island with bad people that tortured people. Before he got captured, he was the same type of
  person that he targets while he is hunting down bad people as the Arrow.
  <h3>Life on the island</h3>
  "The island", a remote island in the sea close to Upindian Eastern Eurasia, was a place that he first learned to use the bow
  and arrow. Like the Flash, he did not want to kill people, but he was under the threat of having his friends tortured, beaten
  and/or killed, so he had no choice. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.

  What inspired him to become the Arrow was his father telling him that he has "failed this city". This is the same thing that
  the Arrow told people before he arrowed them. Because his father was on a boat and going to die, he tried and failed to shoot
  himself. A similar fate happened to Sara, a young woman who was on the boat, who was living but no one knew he was living.
  He secretly joined the Arrow's forces and he decided to be a "copycat" person. He worked with Sara Lance, Laurel's "dead"
  sister.
  <h3>Life as the Arrow</h3>
  As the Arrow, he made a lot of friends and enemies. There was a man named Jason Diggle who was a veteran who believed in
  helping the world whether it is through the military, donations, or being a vigilante. He fought in Afghanistan to stop a
  rogue division of the Accelerati from poisoning the water with tritium and stopping people from drinking the water. Diggle
  had to know how to recognize an ally, and that was the reason that he chose to be with Oliver Queen as his securrity guard.
  <h3>Life pretending to be a rich 1 percenter</h3>
  <h3>Why he wasn't arrested immediately</h3>
  Despite the fact that the high-level officials knew that the Arrow was Oliver Queen, they did nothing about it because they
  wanted to know if he could stop doing it. They knew this through facial recognition software and they did not tell anyone
  and that information was classified. The United Places, the equivalent of the United Nations, decided that the Arrow was
  a valuable resource to catch criminals and that they should try to arrest him to discourage further vigilante activity and
  maintain order.

  Despite the fact that this world is so much better, there are still dark spots. These include places like the Glades, the
  Desert Hexagon, the northern part of the Korean peninsula, and the settlements that were set up in Antartica back in 1998.
  The UP determined that even though it took less than 24 hours to determine the Arrow's identity, it was worth having those
  people die after having intense ethics debates. Most of the people there were not given the Arrow's identity; they were just
  described to him as every normal person knew him as: "The Green Arrow". The public opinion poll was, excluding undecideds,
  68% in favor and 32% against. The 24 expert jurors voted 14 to 10 that they should have him free. His true identity was not
  disclosed to the ethics jurors either.

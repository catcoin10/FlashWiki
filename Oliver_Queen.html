<h1>Oliver Queen</h1>
  <b>Oliver Daniel Queen</b>, also known as <b>Arrow</b>, <b>The Arrow</b>, is a vigilante that lives in Starling City who
  hides as who you would least expect it to be: a 1 percenter. He was active from the years 2015 to 2022. This happened because
  he was trapped on an isolated island with bad people that tortured people. Before he got captured, he was the same type of
  person that he targets while he is hunting down bad people as the Arrow.
  <h3>Life on the island</h3>
  "The island", a remote island in the sea close to Upindian Eastern Eurasia, was a place that he first learned to use the bow
  and arrow. Like the Flash, he did not want to kill people, but he was under the threat of having his friends tortured, beaten
  and/or killed, so he had no choice. He knew what he was doing was wrong, but he did it anyway.
  <br>
  What inspired him to become the Arrow was his father telling him that he has "failed this city". This is the same thing that
  the Arrow told people before he arrowed them. Because his father was on a boat and going to die, he tried and failed to shoot
  himself. A similar fate happened to Sara, a young woman who was on the boat, who was living but no one knew he was living.
  He secretly joined the Arrow's forces and he decided to be a "copycat" person. He worked with Sara Lance, Laurel's "dead"
  sister.
  <br>
  The island left a scar on all three of the future "arrows" that were captured. 
  <h3>Life as the Arrow</h3>
  As the Arrow, he made a lot of friends and enemies. There was a man named Jason Diggle who was a veteran who believed in
  helping the world whether it is through the military, donations, or being a vigilante. He fought the Taliban to stop that
  rogue division of the Accelerati from poisoning the water with tritium and stopping people from drinking the water. Diggle
  had to know how to recognize an ally, and that was the reason that he chose to be with Oliver Queen as his securrity guard.
  <br>
  Later on, a computer engineer and hacker named <a href="Felicity_Smoak.html">Felicity Smoak</a> joined forces. She worked for
  cybersecurity for Queen Consolidated and she was one of the best computer people who graduated from MIT, which despite being
  a new world, kept its acronym and changed it to Midmerican Institute of Technology with a lot more students than the original
  one can have. When Oliver is in this life as the Arrow, he is sometimes conflicted between hurting people or not.
  <br>
  In the police department, Laurel proves to be a useful resource because she is willing to take information on the Arrow.
  This is until <a href="Thomas_Merlyn.html">Tommy Merlyn</a>, the son of <a href-"Malcolm_Merlyn.html">Malcolm Merlyn</a>, a
  villain that does a lot of bad stuff, like trying to set off an earthquake in the Glades.
  <br>
  When Lauren gets involved with Tommy, she learns that he does not like the Arrow, but likes the Flash because the Arrow used
  violence to stop things. The reason that the Arrow did this stuff is because he believed that the authorities were not doing
  enough and that it was outside of their capabilities because the legal authorities, in his point of view are <i>legal</i>
  authorities, which means that they don't do what the law says that they can't because they are bound to the law and the
  Arrow doesn't think he is.
  <br>
  <a href="The_Undertaking.html">The Undertaking</a>, a plan that was created by Malcolm Merlyn, is a plan that was plotted for
  years by Malcolm Merlyn, a very bad person who the United Places were not able to take out because of bribes, was a man that
  was trying to build an earthquake machine that destroys one of the very few major bad places in MidMerica left: The Glades.
  This was about pleasure and hatred for the poor, but also for the revenge of his wife.
  <br>
  Five months before the Flash arrested him, Felicity Smoak hacked into their mainframe. They immediately detected a security
  breach, traced it back to Felicity Smoak in two hours, learned while tracing her that she was an employee of the Arrow, and
  that is what stopped them from forwarding the information to the police. Plus, when she dug further, partially because one
  of the people there planted it there (she could tell, then she dug deeper, and then found the exact same thing that wasn't
  planted there). This was done because she was powerless to stop it. Merlyn did not bribe them with yachts, but he bribed them
  by offering them usage of the mainframe of his company that is used by the MidMerican Universal Basic Income system that was
  launched in 2019.
  <h3>Life pretending to be a rich 1 percenter</h3>
  <h3>Why he wasn't arrested immediately</h3>
  Despite the fact that the high-level officials knew that the Arrow was Oliver Queen, they did nothing about it because they
  wanted to know if he could stop doing it. They knew this through facial recognition software and they did not tell anyone
  and that information was classified. The United Places, the equivalent of the United Nations, decided that the Arrow was
  a valuable resource to catch criminals and that they should try to arrest him to discourage further vigilante activity and
  maintain order.
  <br>
  Despite the fact that this world is so much better, there are still dark spots. These include places like the Glades, the
  Desert Hexagon, the northern part of the Korean peninsula, and the settlements that were set up in Antartica back in 1998.
  The UP determined that even though it took less than 24 hours to determine the Arrow's identity, it was worth having those
  people die after having intense ethics debates. Most of the people there were not given the Arrow's identity; they were just
  described to him as every normal person knew him as: "The Green Arrow". The public opinion poll was, excluding undecideds,
  68% in favor and 32% against. The 24 expert jurors voted 14 to 10 that they should have him free. His true identity was not
  disclosed to the ethics jurors either.
  <br>
  As time went on, it was clear that the Arrow was someone that should be kept free. The police might catch him someday, but
  they would never suspect it to be Oliver Queen. But, once, they caught him without his mask on, then they called in
  Detective Lance, and they arrested him at his home because he was busted being the Arrow. He stayed in prison for two months,
  but, as the United Places expected, the police did not have enough evidence.
  <br>
  Even though the Barry Allen supported the cause that Oliver Queen was pushing, he knew something had to be done. He made the
  apprehension while he was with Roy Harper, a boy/young man that he was trying to train to be someone like him. Oliver did not
  notice anything except for a breeze of wind.
  <br>
  When Queen was being arrested, he was told, "I am not going to turn you into the police. You need help controlling your anger
  towards the things that your very own family did to you and the people of your city. You can do this without wanting
  revenge." The Flash was not lying. While the arrest was happening, the metahuman stuff was pretty quiet and all of the
  scientists, including the real Harrison Wells from Earth 3, was home.
  <h3>Life in the Flash's custody</h3>
  Unlike the city prison, Oliver's stay was mediocre relative to life of the average citizen of Starling City, his home city.
